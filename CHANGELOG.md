## [Unreleased]

Pre-release hardening toward `v1.0.0-rc.1`. Built across Plan v2 phases 0–6.

### 0.9.8 — LIVE-protocol de-dilution + live-carding enforcement (2026-06-05)
- **SKILL.md LIVE section de-diluted (#73, `7317709`)** — replaced the generic
  7-step `add→fly` list with **three laws** (declare-don't-record · one-pulse-at-a-
  time · the Stop hook can't gate batching) + a **shape→pattern table** covering all
  five work shapes (single unit / multiple to-dos / plan mode / phase-tier / mid-task
  branch). Derived from 5 parallel simulations of the proper-carding outcome.
- **Stop hook: batched-not-live detector (#74, `31ab943`)** — `detect_batched()`
  flags cards that reached Done this session with no in-flight dwell (Task→Done jump,
  or <30s in In-Progress), using `card.history` events and scoped to the window since
  the last Stop. **Non-blocking** advisory — surfaces the add→done smell the rev/marker
  checks were structurally blind to. Paired SKILL.md Law #3 rewrite.
- **card-before-edit PreToolUse WARN hook (#75, `9683820`)** — new
  `_hook_card_before_edit.py`: on an edit inside a board project with NO In-Progress
  card, injects a non-blocking `additionalContext` reminder to declare the unit first
  (law #1). Never blocks; conservative + 60s-debounced. Wired into `hooks.json`,
  `install_hooks.py` (in the `all`/`live` set; `--uninstall` removes it), `clean_slate.sh`
  (+ the previously-uncleaned `.stop_recon_state.json` sidecar), and BOOTSTRAP.md.
- **SKILL.md #5 clarified as the explicit exception (#76, `aa3a373`)** — the mid-task
  branch row now states up front it's the one shape where new work nests as a *subtask*,
  not a new card (resolving the apparent contradiction with the "new work = new card" rows).
- Module invariant: 33 → **34** script modules (the new hook leaf), all import-clean, no cycles.

### Changed — autonomous fill is the default (2026-05-31)
- **`--bootstrap-mode` / `install.sh --fill` default flipped `inline → haiku`** —
  a fresh install now fills the board **autonomously** (no main-Claude step), the
  "npx-install just works" experience. It uses the user's existing Claude login
  via `claude -p` — **no API key**. `inline` stays as an opt-in (free, full
  context, highest quality, but waits on a live session to emit).

### Fixed — haiku fill: speed, robustness, demo auth (2026-05-31)
- **`MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=0`** (`f36a25b`) — the haiku-fill slowness was extended
  *thinking* tokens (~5k/call → ~50s), not card verbosity, MCP, or chunk size.
  Forcing them off cut a full harvest **209s → 34s (~6×)** with identical quality.
- **Robust JSON salvage** (`5327920`) — `parse_card_array` recovers cards from
  prose-wrapped or truncated model output (jsonl digests carry chat turns that
  derail Haiku into prose), eliminating the 90s-timeout retry cascade.
- **`--demo` haiku auth** (`e09fb68`) — the isolated demo config dir broke
  `claude -p`; `_LLM_ENV` now honors `BOARD_REAL_CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` so every
  `claude -p` call (harvest + `serve.py` bootstrap) authenticates against the
  user's real login instead of filling 0 cards while printing "fill complete".

### Added — auto-logging (Phase 3, the VISION "zero-input" promise)
- **Auto-card on idea-intent** (`#100`) — `card.py add --auto`; deferred-intent
  markers in a prompt create a card with a 5-second Undo toast.
- **Auto-ship after commit** (`#101`) — `card.py auto-ship` scores In-Progress
  cards against `git log` and writes the completion summary from matched commits.
- **Auto-link files to cards** (`#102`) — a `PreToolUse` hook flashes a card on
  the board when Claude edits a file linked to it (`/flash` SSE endpoint).

### Added — data-safety (Phase 3.5)
- Cross-process `flock` + rolling backups on every write (`_boardio.py`).
- `card.py recover` — list / restore rolling backups (validated, reversible).
- `card.py migrate` — idempotent, `schemaVersion`-driven schema migrations.
- `card.py repair-links` — fix dangling / self / duplicate / one-sided links.

### Added — cross-platform autostart (Phase 4)
- `install_autostart.py` dispatcher → `install_launchd.py` (macOS),
  `install_systemd.py` (Linux), `install_taskscheduler.py` (Windows). Identical
  flags on every OS; unprivileged; refuses a real install on the wrong OS.

### Added — token-efficiency read tier (Phase 5)
- `card.py digest [--json]` — ~120-token board pulse on demand.
- `card.py query` — sliced JSON; `--fields` projection, `--since-days`, `--limit`.
- `card.py wiki` — narrative Markdown render.
- SKILL.md documents the `digest → query → show → board.json` ladder.

### Added — scale + share (Phase 5.5)
- **Export** (`#115`) — `card.py export` and `serve.py /export.md` / `/export.html`
  produce a standalone, no-JS sprint snapshot. Shared renderer in `_render.py`.
- **Velocity metrics** (`#114`) — `serve.py /metrics?since=Nd`, `card.py metrics`,
  and a Velocity tab in the UI (throughput, cycle time, blockers, priority drift).
- **LAN access + auth** (`#116`) — `serve.py --auth-token`; bearer token via
  `Authorization` / `?t=` / cookie, constant-time compare; prints a scan-me LAN
  URL. `card.py` carries `$BOARD_AUTH_TOKEN` on its writes.

### Pending before `v1.0.0-rc.1`
- `#113` lazy-render + incremental SSE diff for 500+ card boards (Phase 5.5, deferred).
- `#112`/`#245` full-text / Cmd+K search.
- `#247` inline hourly transition extractor.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-26
- Initial commit — WorkBoard kanban skill extracted from `board-steward`:
  live SSE board (`serve.py` + `board.html`), `card.py` CLI, `index.json`
  digest, archive sweep, history bootstrap (`discover.py`), SessionStart hook,
  launchd autostart, self-telemetry.
